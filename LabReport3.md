# Lab Report 3 - Researching Commands (Week 5) 
I'll be using the command line ```grep``` in order to find more options
## Command-line Option 1
The first command-line option I chose to test out was adding a ```-n```. This basically displays the matched lines as well as the exact line number in which it is found. Below are two examples of me using this feature within the ```technical/911report``` directory.

Not only is the basic grep function already very very useful, this also enables us to directly find exactly which line the words are found on. This could be useful in scenarios such as debugging or whatnot where there is a hefty amount of words/lines where this desired information might be difficult to find. I found this first option on [Link](http://a.com](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)
